# scripts

All my useful scripts (of any language) that don't quite deserve their own repo.

If these scripts get expanded, will perhaps get expanded into their own repos/python modules/binaries
etc as required.


[Test][test] and [inline](https://www.duckduckgo.com) and [bad](https://www.httpstat.us/404) links for testing my `mdlc` script.
